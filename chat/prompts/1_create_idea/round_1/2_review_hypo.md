<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Readability as Circuit Resistance
hypothesis: >-
  Text readability can be accurately modeled through the effective electrical resistance of a discourse graph. When sentences
  are represented as nodes and semantic discourse connections as weighted edges (resistors), the total effective resistance
  (Kirchhoff index) of this graph provides a novel, physically-motivated readability metric. The key insight is that readable
  text creates 'low-resistance pathways' for information flow - coherent discourse with strong semantic connections allows
  information to flow easily (low resistance), while disjointed or complex text impedes information flow (high resistance).
motivation: >-
  Current readability formulas rely on surface features (sentence length, word difficulty) or black-box ML models that don't
  explicitly model the cognitive process of reading. Drawing from electrical network theory, we propose that readable text
  should allow 'easy information flow' through semantic connections, analogous to current flowing through a low-resistance
  circuit. This provides a theoretically grounded, interpretable metric that captures discourse-level coherence in a way surface
  features cannot.
assumptions:
- >-
  Text can be meaningfully represented as a graph where sentences are nodes and edges represent discourse connections (semantic
  similarity, rhetorical relations, or sequential adjacency)
- >-
  The cognitive effort of reading correlates with the 'resistance' to information flow through the discourse graph
- >-
  Edge weights (resistances) can be meaningfully assigned based on semantic distance or discourse relation strength
- >-
  The effective graph resistance (Kirchhoff index) computed from this weighted graph correlates with human judgments of readability
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Construct discourse graphs from texts: nodes=sentences, edges=semantic connections weighted by cosine distance between
  sentence embeddings (or simplified: sequential edges with weights based on position). 2. Compute the effective graph resistance
  (trace of Laplacian pseudoinverse) as the readability score. 3. Evaluate on standard readability datasets (e.g., Weebit,
  CLEAR) by correlating with human ratings. 4. Compare against traditional formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG) and ML baselines.
  5. Perform ablation: test different graph construction methods (sequential only, similarity-thresholded, full RST parsing).
success_criteria: >-
  The effective resistance metric should: (1) Achieve Pearson correlation r > 0.7 with human readability ratings on standard
  benchmarks, (2) Outperform or match traditional readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) in predictive accuracy, (3)
  Show significant correlation (p < 0.01) with reading time/eye-tracking measures if available, (4) Be computationally feasible
  (< 1s per document for typical lengths). A tiny experiment (N=50 texts with human ratings) showing r > 0.5 would support
  proceeding to full evaluation.

  Mesgar & Strube (2015) 'Graph-based Coherence Modeling For Assessing Readability' - Uses entity grids and discourse relation
  graphs with features like outdegree and frequent subgraphs, but does NOT use effective resistance. Our approach differs
  by using the actual electrical network resistance as the direct readability metric, which captures global information flow
  rather than local graph patterns.
- >-
  Zhang et al. (2026) 'Automatic text readability assessment for educational content based on graph representation learning'
  - Uses GCNs on POS-based dependency graphs. This is a deep learning approach that learns features implicitly, whereas our
  method uses a specific, interpretable graph metric (effective resistance) derived from network theory.
- >-
  Guinaudeau & Strube (2013) 'Graph-based coherence modeling' - Introduces entity graphs and one-mode projections for coherence
  modeling. Our work differs by using effective resistance (a global spectral graph property) rather than local features like
  edge weights or components.
- >-
  Ehret (2018) 'Kolmogorov complexity as a universal measure of language complexity' - Uses compression-based complexity.
  While both approaches use information theory concepts, effective resistance captures discourse-level connectivity while
  Kolmogorov complexity captures lexical/syntactic redundancy.
- >-
  Klein et al. (2025) 'Surprisal Takes It All: Eye Tracking Based Cognitive Evaluation of Text Readability Measures' - Finds
  surprisal (from language models) predicts reading ease. Our approach is complementary: effective resistance models discourse
  structure while surprisal models lexical predictability.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws from electrical network theory (Kirchhoff's laws, effective resistance) and its application to graph
  analysis. In electrical engineering, the effective resistance between nodes in a network captures how easily current can
  flow. We adapt this to text by treating discourse connections as electrical pathways: coherent, well-connected text has
  low 'resistance' to information flow, while disjointed or complex text has high resistance. This cross-domain transfer from
  circuit theory to readability assessment is, to our knowledge, novel.
terms:
- term: Effective resistance (Kirchhoff index)
  definition: >-
    The sum of resistance distances between all pairs of nodes in a graph, equivalent to the trace of the pseudoinverse of
    the graph Laplacian. In electrical networks, this represents the total resistance 'seen' by current flowing through the
    network.
- term: Graph Laplacian
  definition: >-
    A matrix representation of a graph L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. The pseudoinverse
    of L is used to compute effective resistances between nodes.
- term: Discourse graph
  definition: >-
    A graph representation of text where nodes represent sentences or discourse units, and edges represent rhetorical relations,
    semantic connections, or sequential adjacency.
- term: Resistance distance
  definition: >-
    A graph metric derived from electrical network theory that measures the effective electrical resistance between two nodes
    if unit resistors are placed on each edge. It captures both direct and indirect pathways between nodes.
- term: Kirchhoff index
  definition: >-
    The sum of all pairwise resistance distances in a graph. It is a global graph invariant that measures the overall 'connectivity'
    or 'flow capacity' of the network.
summary: >-
  We propose a novel readability metric based on effective electrical resistance of discourse graphs. By modeling text as
  a circuit where sentences are connected by semantic pathways, the total resistance to information flow (Kirchhoff index)
  provides a physically-motivated, interpretable measure of readability that captures discourse-level coherence beyond surface
  features.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
