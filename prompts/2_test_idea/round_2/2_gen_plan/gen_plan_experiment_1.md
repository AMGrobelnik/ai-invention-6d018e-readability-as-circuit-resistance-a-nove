<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Readability as Circuit Resistance
hypothesis: >-
  Text readability can be modeled through effective electrical resistance of discourse graphs with SEMANTIC edges between
  sentences. The Kirchhoff index of graphs where edges are weighted by semantic similarity (cosine distance between SBERT
  embeddings) provides a readability metric that captures discourse coherence beyond sentence count. Unlike sequential-only
  graphs (which reduce to sentence counting and produce trivially few distinct values), semantic edges enable the metric to
  capture meaningful variance in discourse structure. The first experiment using sequential edges and synthetic data with
  limited sentence counts (1-3 sentences) was invalid and must be repeated with rich discourse graphs and established benchmarks
  containing real human judgments.
motivation: >-
  Current readability formulas rely on surface features (sentence length, word difficulty) or black-box ML models that don't
  explicitly model the cognitive process of reading. Drawing from electrical network theory, we propose that readable text
  should allow 'easy information flow' through semantic connections, analogous to current flowing through a low-resistance
  circuit. This provides a theoretically grounded, interpretable metric that captures discourse-level coherence in a way surface
  features cannot.
assumptions:
- >-
  Text can be meaningfully represented as a graph where sentences are nodes and edges represent discourse connections (semantic
  similarity, rhetorical relations, or sequential adjacency)
- >-
  The cognitive effort of reading correlates with the 'resistance' to information flow through the discourse graph
- >-
  Edge weights (resistances) can be meaningfully assigned based on semantic distance or discourse relation strength
- >-
  The effective graph resistance (Kirchhoff index) computed from this weighted graph correlates with human judgments of readability
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Construct discourse graphs from texts: nodes=sentences, edges=semantic connections weighted by cosine distance between
  sentence embeddings (or simplified: sequential edges with weights based on position). 2. Compute the effective graph resistance
  (trace of Laplacian pseudoinverse) as the readability score. 3. Evaluate on standard readability datasets (e.g., Weebit,
  CLEAR) by correlating with human ratings. 4. Compare against traditional formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG) and ML baselines.
  5. Perform ablation: test different graph construction methods (sequential only, similarity-thresholded, full RST parsing).
success_criteria: >-
  The effective resistance metric should: (1) Achieve Pearson correlation r > 0.7 with human readability ratings on standard
  benchmarks, (2) Outperform or match traditional readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) in predictive accuracy, (3)
  Show significant correlation (p < 0.01) with reading time/eye-tracking measures if available, (4) Be computationally feasible
  (< 1s per document for typical lengths). A tiny experiment (N=50 texts with human ratings) showing r > 0.5 would support
  proceeding to full evaluation.

  Mesgar & Strube (2015) 'Graph-based Coherence Modeling For Assessing Readability' - Uses entity grids and discourse relation
  graphs with features like outdegree and frequent subgraphs, but does NOT use effective resistance. Our approach differs
  by using the actual electrical network resistance as the direct readability metric, which captures global information flow
  rather than local graph patterns.
- >-
  Zhang et al. (2026) 'Automatic text readability assessment for educational content based on graph representation learning'
  - Uses GCNs on POS-based dependency graphs. This is a deep learning approach that learns features implicitly, whereas our
  method uses a specific, interpretable graph metric (effective resistance) derived from network theory.
- >-
  Guinaudeau & Strube (2013) 'Graph-based coherence modeling' - Introduces entity graphs and one-mode projections for coherence
  modeling. Our work differs by using effective resistance (a global spectral graph property) rather than local features like
  edge weights or components.
- >-
  Ehret (2018) 'Kolmogorov complexity as a universal measure of language complexity' - Uses compression-based complexity.
  While both approaches use information theory concepts, effective resistance captures discourse-level connectivity while
  Kolmogorov complexity captures lexical/syntactic redundancy.
- >-
  Klein et al. (2025) 'Surprisal Takes It All: Eye Tracking Based Cognitive Evaluation of Text Readability Measures' - Finds
  surprisal (from language models) predicts reading ease. Our approach is complementary: effective resistance models discourse
  structure while surprisal models lexical predictability.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws from electrical network theory (Kirchhoff's laws, effective resistance) and its application to graph
  analysis. In electrical engineering, the effective resistance between nodes in a network captures how easily current can
  flow. We adapt this to text by treating discourse connections as electrical pathways: coherent, well-connected text has
  low 'resistance' to information flow, while disjointed or complex text has high resistance. This cross-domain transfer from
  circuit theory to readability assessment is, to our knowledge, novel.
terms:
- term: Effective resistance (Kirchhoff index)
  definition: >-
    The sum of resistance distances between all pairs of nodes in a graph, equivalent to the trace of the pseudoinverse of
    the graph Laplacian. In electrical networks, this represents the total resistance 'seen' by current flowing through the
    network.
- term: Graph Laplacian
  definition: >-
    A matrix representation of a graph L = D - A, where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. The pseudoinverse
    of L is used to compute effective resistances between nodes.
- term: Discourse graph
  definition: >-
    A graph representation of text where nodes represent sentences or discourse units, and edges represent rhetorical relations,
    semantic connections, or sequential adjacency.
- term: Resistance distance
  definition: >-
    A graph metric derived from electrical network theory that measures the effective electrical resistance between two nodes
    if unit resistors are placed on each edge. It captures both direct and indirect pathways between nodes.
- term: Kirchhoff index
  definition: >-
    The sum of all pairwise resistance distances in a graph. It is a global graph invariant that measures the overall 'connectivity'
    or 'flow capacity' of the network.
summary: >-
  We propose a novel readability metric based on effective electrical resistance of discourse graphs. By modeling text as
  a circuit where sentences are connected by semantic pathways, the total resistance to information flow (Kirchhoff index)
  provides a physically-motivated, interpretable measure of readability that captures discourse-level coherence beyond surface
  features.
_relation_rationale: >-
  First experiment invalid (only 2 values); refining to require semantic edges, not just sequential.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Added REQUIREMENT for semantic edges (SBERT embeddings) instead of just sequential edges
- >-
  Acknowledged first experiment was invalid: only 2 distinct values, correlation = sentence count
- >-
  Added success criterion: metric must produce continuous range of values across diverse texts
- >-
  Added success criterion: partial correlation controlling for sentence count must remain significant
- >-
  Changed evaluation to use established benchmarks (CLEAR, WeeBit) with REAL human judgments
- >-
  Added ablation comparing sequential-only vs. semantic edges to quantify discourse contribution
- Emphasized edge weights must be based on semantic distance, not uniform
- Noted normalization scheme needs theoretical justification

objective: >-
  Implement effective resistance metric with SBERT semantic edges and comprehensively evaluate on CLEAR corpus, addressing
  all major reviewer issues
approach: >-
  Implement and evaluate the FULL method as specified in the hypothesis. DATA PREP: Download CLEAR corpus directly from GitHub
  (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrosseye/CLEAR-Corpus/main/data/clear_corpus.csv) since executor has full Python access.
  METHOD: (1) Sentence segmentation using NLTK, (2) SBERT embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), (3) Build discourse graph with SEMANTIC
  edges: connect all sentence pairs with cosine similarity > threshold (try 0.3, 0.5), weight edges by 1/(1+cosine_similarity)
  as resistance. For comparison, also build sequential-only graph, (4) Compute Kirchhoff index via Laplacian pseudoinverse
  using scipy.linalg.pinv, (5) Try multiple normalization schemes: raw Kf, Kf/n, Kf/n^2, average resistance distance. EVALUATION:
  (a) PRIMARY: Pearson/Spearman correlation with human judgments on 1-100 scale, (b) MAE/RMSE on original 1-100 scale (NOT
  z-normalized), (c) CRITICAL CHECK: Number of distinct values produced (>10 required), (d) PARTIAL CORRELATION: controlling
  for sentence count to prove metric captures discourse not just sentence count, (e) Compare sequential-only vs semantic edges
  (ablation), (f) Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 resamples), (g) Runtime scaling: 10, 50, 100, 500 sentences. OUTPUT:
  All metrics on correct scales, distinct value count, partial correlation results, ablation comparison, runtime plot data.

title: Effective Resistance for Readability Graphs Research
summary: >-
  This research artifact provides comprehensive findings on three foundational components for implementing a 'Readability
  as Circuit Resistance' metric: (1) Computing effective resistance (Kirchhoff index) from graph Laplacian pseudoinverse -
  identified NetworkX built-in functions (resistance_distance, effective_graph_resistance) and netneurotools library with
  implementation code examples and numerical stability considerations. (2) Constructing discourse graphs from text - documented
  three edge construction methods (sequential, similarity-based with SBERT, RST-based), edge weighting schemes, and relevant
  Python libraries (sentence-transformers, NetworkX, RST parsers). (3) Identifying readability benchmark datasets - compiled
  detailed comparison of 5 datasets (WeeBit, CLEAR, Newsela, OneStopEnglish, Wikilarge) with sizes, rating scales, access
  methods, and licensing information. The artifact includes an implementation roadmap with specific library recommendations,
  sample code for computing resistance scores from text, and an evaluation plan using the CLEAR corpus. Confidence levels
  are assessed for each finding, and follow-up research questions are provided.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
